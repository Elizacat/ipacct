ipacct - stupidly simple IP accounting
======================================

This dumps IP accounting information into an Excel-compatible CSV file. It can
also automatically spew IP's based on IP blocks configurable in a file. It does
basic sanity checks before adding it to the database.

## TODO ##

- Cleanups
- Allow comma-separated list of blocks
- Additional information attached to blocks like gateway, blacklisted IP's, etc.
  (maybe make it an ini file?)
